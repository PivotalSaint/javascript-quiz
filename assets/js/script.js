// GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
// WHEN I click the start button


// need to add button that prompts or starts code with a timer




// THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
// timer needs to be set function with total time and a variable to subtract that time
// Add timer function here




// WHEN I answer a question
// Need to add function that logs data and keeps the data stored by the window
// this variable will effect timer as well if not true and is false
var questionDisplayed = document.createElement("ol");

var answer1 = document.createElement("li");
var answer2 = document.createElement("li");
var answer3 = document.createElement("li");
var answer4 = document.createElement("li");


// THEN I am presented with another question
// so variable has to loop with continuous timer and function for questions has to continue





// WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
// THEN time is subtracted from the clock
// add function to subtract time in milliseconds from overall time left




// WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
// THEN the game is over
// WHEN the game is over
// THEN I can save my initials and score
